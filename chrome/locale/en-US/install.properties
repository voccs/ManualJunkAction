amo.description=Introduces an option to specifically set which folder manually marked junk will go to per account (see Junk Settings under Account Settings).  Please note that these settings will not work if the global preference (under application Preferences, then Security, then Junk) for moving mail to an account's Junk folder is enabled.  Make sure it's unchecked if you intend to use this extension.
amo.developer_comments=This extension no longer requires overrides thanks to a re-engineering of folder listing in Thunderbird 3.  There are no additional features planned for this extension other than maintaining compatibility as Thunderbird improves.
amo.release_notes=ManualJunkAction 0.3 is a compatibility release for Thunderbird 3.
